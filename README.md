<h1 align="center"> ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿Crop Recommendation System</h1>

With the increasing popularity of precision agriculture, the integration of machine learning has become essential. This project showcases one of the numerous applications of machine learning in precision agriculture by utilizing [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) derived from India's Climate, Rainfall, and Fertilizer datasets, thus demonstrating its potential for the entire process.

## On Model
Trained with a dataset containing details of the profile of about 2200 agricultural farms, the Machine Learning system achieves 99% accuracy in making recommendations on the right crop to plant from 22 different crop types, such as rice, jute, kidney beans, coffee, cotton, lentil.

The variables in the dataset are:

* N (ratio of Nitrogen content in soil)
* P (ratio of Phosphorous content in soil)
* K (ratio of Potassium content in soil)
* ph (pH value of soil)
* temperature (temperature in degree Celsius)
* humidity (relative humidity in %)
* rainfall (rainfall in mm)

Please, refer to the attached jupyter notebook detailing the process: "crop-recommendation-system.ipynb". To run the model on your local machine,  download the attached jupyter notebook and the dataset, "Crop_recommendation.csv", and place them on the same directory.

## Recomendation
A recommended next step  is to create an API for the model.
